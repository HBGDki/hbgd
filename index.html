<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>The “hbgd” R package is a collection of visual and analytic methods for the study of healthy birth, growth, and development in children.</p>
<p>This document provides a walk through of much of the package’s functionality, provided through examples and discussion. The <a href="rd.html">package reference</a> page has an exhaustive listing of all of the exported functions in the package along with detailed documentation about their parameters and usage.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The hbgd package is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from a CRAN-like repository with the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(repos = c(
  CRAN = &quot;http://cran.rstudio.com/&quot;,
  deltarho = &quot;http://packages.deltarho.org&quot;))
install.packages(&quot;hbgd&quot;)</code></pre>
<!-- Note that some of the package dependencies for hbgd rely on Bioconductor packages, and you may need to install Bioconductor to get a successful install.  If this is the case, you need to run the following:
```r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rgraphviz")
```
 -->
<p>Once the package is is installed, you simply need to load it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(hbgd)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading required package: datadr</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading required package: trelliscope</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="working-with-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Working With Data</h1>
<p>The primary type of data this package is meant to deal with is longitudinal anthropometric growth measurements with associated variables having to do with health/interventions/insults, along with per-subject meta data.</p>
<div id="cpp-sample-data" class="section level2">
<h2>CPP sample data</h2>
<p>A subset of growth data from the <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/606622">collaborative perinatal project (CPP)</a> is shipped with this package to serve as an example for the various methods available in the package.</p>
<p>The data set looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(cpp)</code></pre>

<p>While you can use most of the functionality of this package with data in your own format, it will be most convenient to transform your variable names to match those found <code>hbgd_labels</code>.</p>

<div id="data-checking" class="section level2">
<h2>Data checking</h2>
<p>The functions in this package were designed to work on data with specific variable names and types. Instead of trying to accommodate every possible dataset one might bring to use with the package, a thorough data checking method, <code><a href='rd.html#check_data_alias'>check_data</a>()</code> is provided with the package that helps guide the user to transform their data into a conforming format.</p>
<p>To get a feel for what the output of this function looks like and what it checks, we can try it on our cpp dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_data(cpp, has_hcir = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Checking if data is a data frame... ✓
Checking variable name case... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;subjid&#39;... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;agedays&#39;... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;sex&#39;... ✓
Checking values of variable &#39;sex&#39;... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;lencm&#39;... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;htcm&#39;... ✓
Checking for variable &#39;wtkg&#39;... ✓
Checking for both &#39;lencm&#39; and &#39;htcm&#39;...
Checking z-score variable &#39;haz&#39; for height... ✓
Checking z-score variable &#39;waz&#39; for weight... ✓
Checking to see if data is longitudinal... ✓
Checking names in data that are not standard &#39;hbgd&#39; variables...
All checks passed!
As a final check, please ensure the units of measurement match
the variable descriptions (e.g. age in days, height in centimeters, etc.).</code></pre>
<p>We specify <code>has_hcir = FALSE</code> because this dataset does not have any head circumference data.</p>
<p>From the output, we see that all checks pass, and it reminds us to make sure our variables are in the correct units. Since we are shipping the cpp data with the package, we of course have made sure that it conforms with the required format.</p>
<div id="smocc-data" class="section level4">
<h4>SMOCC data</h4>
<p>Let’s now get a more realistic feel for what we might encounter from <code><a href='rd.html#check_data_alias'>check_data</a>()</code> when we use an outside dataset. The ‘brokenstick’ package which comes as a dependency to ‘hbgd’ has a nice example data set from the SMOCC study (see <code>?brokenstick::smocc.hgtwgt</code> for more details). Let’s check it:</p>

We see that there is a column in the data, <code>id</code>, which has a name similar to <code>subjid</code> that we can guess should be renamed to <code>subjid</code>. We see a similar indication for <code>agedays</code>. It also tells us that it did successfully find a <code>sex</code> variable but that the values need to be “Male” and “Female”. Finally, we see that variables <code>hgt</code> and <code>wgt</code> exist in the data but should be <code>htcm</code> and <code>wtkg</code> to conform with the package.

<p>After the final check, it looks like we are in good shape. It is giving us messages about a <code>lencm</code> variable that is not found (typically length is reported for the first 2 years, then height, but the ‘hbgd’ package looks at the combination of the two as <code>htcm</code>). It also gives a message about variables found in the data set that are not known variables to ‘hbgd’.</p>
<p>Once one is familiar with the standards for data in the package, datasets can be curated to meet these standards beforehand to avoid manual checks like this.</p>

<div id="dealing-with-longitudinal-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Dealing with longitudinal data</h2>
<p>Longitudinal data by definition provides repeated measurements of one or more variables over time for the same subject. However, it often additionally provides a set of <em>subject-level</em> variables - variables that do not change over time for each subject but provide additional demographic or other information about each subject.</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at a few rows and columns of the <code>cpp</code> data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cpp[1:5, c(1, 5:13)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>  subjid lencm      bmi   waz  haz   whz   baz siteid sexn  sex
1      1    55 15.27603  2.38 2.61  0.19  1.35      5    1 Male
2      1    NA       NA  1.99   NA    NA    NA      5    1 Male
3      1    79 23.23346  3.84 1.35  4.02  3.89      5    1 Male

5      2    NA       NA -3.99   NA    NA    NA      5    1 Male</code></pre>
<p>Variables like <code>lencm</code> and <code>bmi</code> are time-varying variables, but variables like <code>siteid</code> and <code>sex</code> are subject-level - they don’t change within each subject.</p>
<p>When dealing with longitudinal data, sometimes we want to look at just subject-level variables. In doing so, we want to transform the data so there is only one record per subject. There is a utility function for this, <code><a href='rd.html#subjecttime_alias'>get_subject_data</a>()</code> that returns only subject-level columns of the data, with one record per subject.</p>

<h2>Meta data</h2>
<p>This package has a utility function, <code><a href='rd.html#get_data_attributes_alias'>get_data_attributes</a>()</code>, that is used behind the scenes to compute meta data about longitudinal data sets. This function does things like infers whether a variable is subject-level or time-varying, and computes some summary statistics that are useful to have on hand like the number of subjects, etc. This function will attach the meta data to the data set’s attributes. We mention it here because it may be useful to know that this meta data exists.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cpp &lt;- get_data_attributes(cpp)</code></pre>
<p>This adds an attribute list called “hbgd” to the the data, which includes a summary about the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(attr(cpp, &quot;hbgd&quot;)$var_summ)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Classes &#39;var_summ&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:    37 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ variable: chr  &quot;subjid&quot; &quot;agedays&quot; &quot;wtkg&quot; &quot;htcm&quot; ...
 $ label   : chr  &quot;Subject ID&quot; &quot;Age since birth at examination (days)&quot; &quot;Weight (kg)&quot; &quot;Standing height (cm)&quot; ...
 $ type    : chr  &quot;subject id&quot; &quot;time indicator&quot; &quot;time-varying&quot; &quot;time-varying&quot; ...
 $ vtype   : chr  &quot;num&quot; &quot;cat&quot; &quot;num&quot; &quot;num&quot; ...
 $ n_unique: int  500 5 417 81 42 956 527 137 413 392 ...</code></pre>
<p>This tells us which variables are subject-level and time-varying variables, and which are categorical vs. numeric. It also adds labels and computes some summary statistics. This information is useful for some of the summary plots that we will be making.</p>
</div>
<div id="dealing-with-lengthheight" class="section level2">
<h2>Dealing with length/height</h2>
<p>Most data sets have a variable for recumbent length measurements, <code>lencm</code>, indicating the measured length of the child up to 2 years, after which a new variable for standing height, <code>htcm</code>, becomes available. For plotting and modeling purposes, it is most often useful to deal with both measurements in the same variable.</p>
<p>There is a utility function, <code><a href='rd.html#fix_height_alias'>fix_height</a>()</code>, that will take the data and return a modified data set where by default the <code>htcm</code> variable will become the combination of both <code>lencm</code> and <code>htcm</code>. This makes the data compatible with WHO growth standard lookups since the WHO lookups in this package reference <code>htcm</code> for both length and height.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cpp &lt;- fix_height(cpp)</code></pre>

<div id="growth-standards" class="section level1">
<h1>Growth Standards</h1>
<p>A major feature of this package is a collection of utility functions for conveniently converting anthropometric measurements to z-scores or centiles (and converting z-scores / centiles to measurements) for three major growth standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>WHO growth standard (functions prefixed with <code>who_</code>)</li>
<li>INTERGROWTH newborn size standard (functions prefixed with <code>igb_</code>)</li>
<li>INTERGROWTH fetal growth standard (functions prefixed with <code>igfet_</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These growth standards have previously not necessarily been easy to access inside an R analysis. In some cases R code has been provided for making conversions with the growth standard but in a form that is difficult to embed and generalize (copying and pasting code that will be frequently used is messy will almost surely lead to errors). Some standards are provided only through published coefficients. The goal here is to put all the standards into a single package with a unified interface, while providing additional functionality like interpolation for regions where a standard’s provided tables are sparse.</p>
<p>The growth standard conversion methods have been painstakingly checked for accuracy through comparisons with the standards provided by the original sources. However, we advise caution and double checking against the original sources when results will impact decisions. Links to the original sources can be found in the sections for each standard below.</p>
<div id="who-growth-standard" class="section level2">
<h2>WHO growth standard</h2>
<p>The WHO growth standard provides international standard distributions for several anthropometric measurements.</p>
<p>The data / methodology for the WHO growth standard functions in this package come from the WHO <a href="http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/">child growth standard</a> and the <a href="http://www.who.int/growthref/tools/en/">5-19 years growth reference</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the WHO provides recumbent length for 0-2 years of age, after which the standing height is provided. Here we have merged the two into a single variable, <code>htcm</code>.</p>
<p>Also note that in almost every case the x variable is <code>agedays</code> - the age since birth in days. When the desired x variable is <code>agedays</code>, a simplified set of functions has been created to convert between z-scores or centiles with the following naming convention, for example, when working with <code>wtkg</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_var2zscore_alias'>who_wtkg2zscore</a>(agedays, wtkg, sex = “Female”)</code>: for specified <code>wtkg</code> values at ages <code>agedays</code>, get the corresponding Female z-scores</li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_var2zscore_alias'>who_wtkg2centile</a>(agedays, wtkg, sex = “Female”)</code>: for specified <code>wtkg</code> values at ages <code>agedays</code>, get the corresponding Female centiles</li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_zscore2var_alias'>who_centile2wtkg</a>(agedays, p = 50, sex = “Female”)</code>: for given centiles (<code>p=50</code>, or median, as default) at ages <code>agedays</code>, get the corresponding <code>wtkg</code> values</li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_zscore2var_alias'>who_zscore2wtkg</a>(agedays, z = 0, sex = “Female”)</code>: for given z-scores (<code>z=0</code> as default) at ages <code>agedays</code>, get the corresponding <code>wtkg</code> values</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working with <code>htcm</code> you can swap <code>wtkg</code> for <code>htcm</code>, etc.</p>
<p>As z-scores are related to centiles through a simple conversion, there is a bit of redundancy in having functions for both, but both are provided for convenience.</p>

<h4>Getting values for combinations of parameters</h4>
<p>We can send vectors of values into any of the functions and lookups in the appropriate tables will be made for each distinct case.</p>
<!-- We can even pass in a data frame with the `data` argument, referencing the appropriate variables by name as arguments to the function. -->
<p>For example, suppose we want to plot the WHO 99th centile of weight for age of boys and girls for the first 4 years of life:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- data.frame(

<div id="generic-who-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Generic WHO functions</h3>
<p>To utility functions described so far all for measurements against age. To deal with the case of height-for-weight WHO calculations, and also to provide a more generic interface to accessing the WHO growth standards, the following functions are also provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_value2zscore_alias'>who_value2zscore</a>(x, y, x_var = “agedays”, y_var = “htcm”, sex = “Female”)</code></li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_value2zscore_alias'>who_value2centile</a>(x, y, x_var = “agedays”, y_var = “htcm”, sex = “Female”)</code></li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_centile2value_alias'>who_centile2value</a>(x, p = 50, x_var = “agedays”, y_var = “htcm”, sex = “Female”)</code></li>
<li><code><a href='rd.html#who_centile2value_alias'>who_zscore2value</a>(x, z = 0, y_var = “htcm”, x_var = “agedays”, sex = “Female”)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here both the x variable and y variable can be specified. For example, the following are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_htcm2centile(agedays = 730.5, htcm = 90)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 88.86932</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>who_value2centile(x = 730.5, y = 90, x_var = &quot;agedays&quot;, y_var = &quot;htcm&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 88.86932</code></pre>
<p>But now we can do things like computing height-for-weight centiles:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_value2centile(x = 90, y = 12, x_var = &quot;htcm&quot;, y_var = &quot;wtkg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 27.61003</code></pre>

<div id="simple-exploration" class="section level1">
<h1>Simple Exploration</h1>
<p>Several functions are available for making simple interactive exploratory plots via the rbokeh package, and many more are planned.</p>
<p>Many of the summary plots have a distinction between plotting “time-varying” and “subject-level” variables. Time-varying variables are variables that vary over time within each subject, while subject-level variables are constant within each subject. When dealing with subject-level variables, instead of plotting summaries over the entire longitudinal data set, we instead subset the data to have one record per subject. For example, in our CPP sample data, there are 500 subjects but nearly 2000 records. When plotting time-varying variables, we have all 2000 records, but when plotting subject-level variables we have 500 records.</p>
<div id="data-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Data distributions</h2>
<p>A simple function is available to plot the univariate distributions of all variables in the data, <code><a href='rd.html#plot_univar_alias'>plot_univar</a>()</code>. You can have it plot using subject-level or time-varying variables. The function returns bar charts for categorical variables and histograms for quantitative variables. The rule for deciding whether a variable is quantitative or categorical is that it is quantitative if it is numeric and has more than 10 unique values and categorical otherwise.</p>

<div id="modeling-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Modeling Methods</h1>
<p>An important necessity for more meaningful analyses and visualizations beyond summaries or looking at the raw data is to fit models to individual subject’s growth trajectories and investigate the results.</p>
<p>There are many reasons we may want to fit growth trajectories:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate the trajectory of every subject at a specific age, when the subjects are measured at irregular time points</li>
<li>study the velocity of each subject’s growth</li>
<li>use the growth curves to extract metrics about the subject’s growth</li>
<li>identify data that deviates from what we perceive as regular growth (noisy around the fitted trajectory, large jumps, etc.)</li>
<li>visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>This package provides a pluggable framework for trajectory modeling techniques. The analyst can quickly swap between different methods and parameter settings and have access to visualizations and diagnostics all through the same interface. The ultimate goal is to provide a class of methods with recommended default choices for different situations (we have found that different data situations - sparse, noisy, etc. - can necessitate different methods) and provide good parameter defaults for each method.</p>
<p>The methods that have been integrated so far fall into two categories: methods that fit trajectories on a subject-specific basis (such as loess smoothing of each subject’s data) and methods that borrow strength across all subjects. The following methods are available:</p>
<p><strong>Subject-specific:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fda</strong>: uses <code>smooth.basisPar()</code> in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html">fda</a> package</li>
<li><strong>gam</strong>: uses <code>gam()</code> in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html">mgcv</a> package</li>
<li><strong>loess</strong>: uses <code>loess()</code> in the base R stats package</li>
<li><strong>smooth.spline</strong>: uses <code>smooth.spline()</code> in the base R stats package</li>
<li><strong>rlm</strong>: uses quadratic (by default) <code>rlm()</code> robust linear model in the base R MASS package</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengh-borrowing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>brokenstick</strong>: uses Stef van Buuren’s broken stick approach</li>
<li><strong>face</strong>: uses Luo Xiao et al.’s <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5718">FACE approach</a></li>
<li><strong>lwmod</strong>: uses Laird &amp; Ware linear or quadratic mixed effects model using <code>lmer()</code> in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html">lme4</a> package</li>
<li><strong>sitar</strong>: uses the SITAR method implemented in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sitar/index.html">sitar</a> package</li>
<li><strong>wand</strong>: uses a spline-based approach by Matt Wand</li>
</ul>
<p>New modeling techniques can be plugged in fairly easily, and outputs from programs like nonmem could potentially be plugged in.</p>
<p>Any good package that is intended for others to use on new data sets will provide good defaults. More work is needed in coming to a consensus on the best default choices. Currently, some considerations that need to be finalized, along with the current default choices, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the best default smoothing method</li>
<li>the best default smoothing parameters for the best smoothing method (each method has defaults, except loess which does an AIC-like selection)</li>
<li>the choice of modeling the raw growth measurements vs. fitting the WHO-transformed z-scores (consensus seems to be fit on the z-score scale)</li>
</ul>
<p>To assist with making these choices, this package provides a collection visualization methods to help assess the goodness-of-fit of each approach. See the <a href="#trelliscope">Trelliscope</a> section and the <a href="#assessing_fits_with_holdouts">“Assessing fits with holdouts”</a> section for more details.</p>
<div id="fitting-a-model-to-a-data-set" class="section level2">
<h2>Fitting a model to a data set</h2>
<p>The first step in getting trajectory fits for a data set is to call the <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code> function, which returns a model and other information with which we can later extract fits for individual subjects.</p>
<p>To get a model fit, at a minimum you need to supply a data argument, the name of the y variable, <code>y_var</code>, and the <code>method</code>. Here we will use a subset of the SMOCC data and apply a model of the height-for-age z-score, <code>&quot;haz&quot;</code> vs. the subject’s age (the default for <code>x_var</code>) using the <code>&quot;wand&quot;</code> model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># get first 200 rows of SMOCC data
smc &lt;- get_smocc_data()[1:2000,]</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>wandfit &lt;- get_fit(smc, y_var = &quot;haz&quot;, method = &quot;wand&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This returns an object that we can use to obtain individual subject fits as we will see in the next section.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what methods are available, you can call:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_avail_methods()</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1] &quot;brokenstick&quot;   &quot;face&quot;          &quot;fda&quot;           &quot;gam&quot;          
 [5] &quot;loess&quot;         &quot;lwmod&quot;         &quot;rlm&quot;           &quot;sitar&quot;        
 [9] &quot;smooth.spline&quot; &quot;wand&quot;         </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="fitting-individual-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2>Fitting individual trajectories</h2>
<p>Once we have a model fit object, getting the fitted growth trajectory for an individual is possible using the <code><a href='rd.html#fit_trajectory_alias'>fit_trajectory</a>()</code> function.</p>
<p>To fit a trajectory, at a minimum you need to supply a data argument and the name of the y variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit &lt;- fit_trajectory(subset(smc, subjid == 10001), wandfit)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s first look at what the output looks like. Our <code>fit</code> object is a list with the following elements:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(fit)</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1] &quot;fit&quot;        &quot;fitgrid&quot;    &quot;checkpoint&quot; &quot;pars&quot;       &quot;xy&quot;        
 [6] &quot;resid&quot;      &quot;data&quot;       &quot;sex&quot;        &quot;x_var&quot;      &quot;y_var&quot;     
[11] &quot;method&quot;    </code></pre>
<p>You can investigate what each one of these looks like on your own, but here is a description of what each of these represents:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xy</code>: a data frame with columns “x” and “y” (and optionally “z” if the variable could be converted using the WHO growth standard) of the original data being fit</li>
<li><code>fit</code>: a vector of the fitted values</li>
<li><code>resid</code>: the residuals of the fit</li>
<li><code>fitgrid</code>: a data frame with the model fits applied across an equally-spaced grid of “x” points with the following columns</li>
<li><code>x</code>: the x-axis grid values</li>
<li><code>y</code>: the model fits at the <code>x</code> values</li>
<li><code>z</code>: (optional) the WHO-transformed z-scores of <code>y</code>, if y is WHO-transformable</li>
<li><code>dy</code>: an estimate of the first-order derivative of the fit</li>
<li><code>dz</code>: (optional) an estimate of the first-order derivative of the z-score transform of the fit, if <code>y</code> is WHO-transformable</li>
<li><code>checkpoint</code>: a data frame of “checkpoint” “x” values at which we (see the following section on trajectory checkpoints) with the following columns:</li>
<li><code>x</code>: the age(s) at which we wish to set a checkpoint for the subject (e.g. a checkpoint at 365 and 730 days)</li>
<li><code>y</code>: the corresponding model fit at the “x” checkpoint values</li>
<li><code>z</code>: the z-score of the model fit at the “x” checkpoint values</li>
<li><code>zcat</code>: a z-score categorization (e.g. &lt;-2 or &gt;-2) for where the subject’s growth falls in the z-score scale at each checkpoint</li>
<li><code>method</code>: the name of the fitting method used</li>
<li><code>pars</code>: a named list of fitting parameters supplied to the particular fitting method</li>
<li><code>data</code>: all columns of the data argument for this subject (preserved for later analyses)</li>
<li><code>sex</code>: the subject’s sex</li>
<li><code>x_var</code>, <code>y_var</code>: the names of the variables used for “x” and “y” in the trajectory fitting</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional parameters to <code><a href='rd.html#fit_trajectory_alias'>fit_trajectory</a>()</code> allow control over some of these outputs, such as specifying the grid points for the grid fit, setting the checkpoints, and setting the z-score bins for the checkpoint z-score categorizations</p>
<div id="plotting-trajectory-fits" class="section level3">
<h3>Plotting trajectory fits</h3>
<p>After inspecting what the output of <code>fit</code> looks like, we can get a better understanding of what’s available by making some plots. We can make simple plots by accessing the data directly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(fit$xy$x, fit$xy$y)
lines(fit$fitgrid$x, fit$fitgrid$y)</code></pre>
<p><img src="docs_files/figure-html/fit_plot1-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>There are also several built-in plot methods. One is simply <code><a href='rd.html#plot.fittedTrajectory_alias'>plot.fittedTrajectory</a>()</code>, which plots the original data points, the fitted trajectory, and the checkpoints superposed over the WHO growth standard:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(fit, x_range = c(0, 755), hover = c(&quot;agedays&quot;, &quot;htcm&quot;))</code></pre>
<div style="display: flex; width: 520px; height: 540px; overflow: hidden">
<div style="background: white; position: absolute; top: 0px, left: 0px; width: 520px; height: 540px;"></div>
<iframe class="widget-lazyload lazy-loading" width="520" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock" data-src="lazy_widgets/4bc2f47d03041ca951c5048189a152a5.html"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Note that even though we fit on the z-scale, <code><a href='rd.html#plot.fittedTrajectory_alias'>plot.fittedTrajectory</a>()</code> plots the raw trajectory.</p>
<p>You can specify variables to show when the raw data points are hovered. The checkpoints are plotted as circles with x’s and when hovered show the z-score category the subject falls under at that checkpoint.</p>
<p>You can also plot the fits on the “d-scale”, which is basically taking the raw fitted curve and subtracting the WHO growth standard using <code>center = TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(fit, x_range = c(0, 755), hover = c(&quot;agedays&quot;, &quot;htcm&quot;), center = TRUE)</code></pre>
<div style="display: flex; width: 520px; height: 540px; overflow: hidden">
<div style="background: white; position: absolute; top: 0px, left: 0px; width: 520px; height: 540px;"></div>
<iframe class="widget-lazyload lazy-loading" width="520" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock" data-src="lazy_widgets/8677fca2d5da94921c7d51e2bdc4cf69.html"></iframe>
</div>
<p>These are height-for-age difference (HAD) scores <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/blog/once-stunted-always-stunted-whats-catch-growth">see here</a>.</p>
<p>We may also want to plot the data on the z-score scale. If the y-variable specified in the fitting method is WHO-transformable, the z-scores are automatically computed and included with the fit. We can plot on the z-score scale with <code><a href='rd.html#plot_z_alias'>plot_z</a>()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_z(fit, hover = c(&quot;agedays&quot;, &quot;wtkg&quot;))</code></pre>
<div style="display: flex; width: 520px; height: 540px; overflow: hidden">
<div style="background: white; position: absolute; top: 0px, left: 0px; width: 520px; height: 540px;"></div>
<iframe class="widget-lazyload lazy-loading" width="520" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock" data-src="lazy_widgets/73e0c6be58b5f21a462a33675aaf4d51.html"></iframe>
</div>
<!-- A line is automatically added that indicates the time and magnitude of the first observed "nadir", or bottom of a dip in the z-score fit.
 -->
<p>From looking at this plot, one would speculate that we are overfitting a bit. This is a quick example of how important it is to visualize the fitted trajectory.</p>
<p>Also, the fitting method automatically computes the velocity of the fit and if applicable the z-score fit. We can plot these with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_velocity(fit)</code></pre>
<div style="display: flex; width: 520px; height: 540px; overflow: hidden">
<div style="background: white; position: absolute; top: 0px, left: 0px; width: 520px; height: 540px;"></div>
<iframe class="widget-lazyload lazy-loading" width="520" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock" data-src="lazy_widgets/d95e912cd62133e454fdf9b830a189d5.html"></iframe>
</div>
<p>And for the z-score scale:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_zvelocity(fit)</code></pre>
<div style="display: flex; width: 520px; height: 540px; overflow: hidden">
<div style="background: white; position: absolute; top: 0px, left: 0px; width: 520px; height: 540px;"></div>
<iframe class="widget-lazyload lazy-loading" width="520" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock" data-src="lazy_widgets/d75d9e9f83da655f4c1d793a45cde3b7.html"></iframe>
</div>
<p>There are some artificial bumps in the velocities due to jumps in the WHO standard having to do with the transition from <code>lencm</code> to <code>htcm</code> and the change in standard data at 2 and 5 years - these are removed by not showing the velocity for a short time period around these times.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-parameters" class="section level3">
<h3>Additional parameters</h3>
<p>Additional parameters can be applied to <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code>, such as transformations to be applied to the x and y variables prior to fitting and any smoothing parameters you wish to pass on to the fitting method. See the function reference for <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div id="fitting-on-the-z-score-scale" class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting on the z-score scale</h3>
<p>Just a reminder of how <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code> works when fitting on the raw vs. z-scale. Often we may want to apply our trajectory fitting on the z-score scale. As seen in the example above, we can do this by simply providing the z-score version of the variable as <code>y_var</code> (such as “waz” instead of “wtkg”). An important thing to remember about this is that <code><a href='rd.html#fit_trajectory_alias'>fit_trajectory</a>()</code> will automatically detect that a z-score variable has been used in the fit and after doing the fitting, it will transform the results such that the object returned will have the same structure as those we get when we provide a raw variable for fitting. In other words, the “y” values in the result object will be on the original scale and the “z” values in the result object will be on the z-score scale - the only difference being that the fitting was done on the z-score scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-use-get_fit" class="section level3">
<h3>Why use get_fit?</h3>
<p>In many cases, you may want to simply run your own fitting method on the data and not use <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code>. This is completely fine. The only things <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code> offers on top of doing it yourself are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting the fit over a grid of points for plotting</li>
<li>allowing specification of growth “checkpoints” for comparisons across subjects</li>
<li>dealing with fitting on the z-score scale</li>
<li>providing a self-contained output with data that can be used as a foundation for other methods to build on top of (a few of which we will see later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve tried to make <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code> as flexible as possible for fine control over model parameters, and have also made it fairly straightforward to plug in a new fitting method (see <a href="#plugging-in-a-new-fitting-method">Plugging in a new fitting method</a> for more details) so that this interface is easy to use regardless of your goals. If you find it not flexible enough or have some ideas to improve it, please <a href="file%20an%20issue">http://github.com/hafen/hbgd/issues</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="trajectory-checkoints" class="section level3">
<h3>Trajectory checkoints</h3>
<p>The notion of computing trajectory “checkpoints” is very useful for a lot of analytical and visualization activities.</p>
<p>Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What percentage of children in this study were stunted at age 2?</li>
<li>Is variable x different for children who were stunted (height z-score &lt; -2) at age 1 but not stunted at age 2 vs. children who remained stunted at age 2?</li>
<li>What is the distrubution of growth velocity at age 1?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many research questions insist that we be able to know a child’s trajectory at a specific point in time. However, most longitudinal growth data sets do not provide data at fixed time points (ages) because this is not how data is collected in real life (we cannot record every child at the exact same age).</p>
<p>To estimate a child’s trajectory at specific time points, we do it as part of the trajectory fitting, using the “checkpoint” argument in <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code>. We will see methods below that take the checkpoint output and help us explore differences between children that fall into different categories at different time points.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="plugging-in-a-new-fitting-method" class="section level2">
<h2>Plugging in a new fitting method</h2>
<p>Plugging in a new fitting method is as simple as creating a new function, <code>fit_method.method_name</code> that returns the right outputs. For example, if I want to add a fitting method called “mymethod”, I would create a function <code>fit_method.mymethod</code>. Then it will be available to call using <code>fit_trajectory(..., method = &quot;mymethod&quot;)</code>. See the source code for <code>fit_method.face</code> for an example of what inputs your method should take and what outputs it should return.</p>
</div>
<div id="fitting-all-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2>Fitting all trajectories</h2>
<p>Typically in a study made up of several subjects, we want to fit growth trajectories for every subject. A convenience function <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code> is available to do this.</p>
<p>For example, to fit the height-for-age trajectory of each subject in the SMOCC sample data, we can do the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_tr &lt;- fit_all_trajectories(smc, wandfit)</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code> is “distributed data object” or “DDO” - basically a list of trajectory fits for each subject, indexed by a key of the subject’s id. DDOs are constructs from an R package <a href="http://github.com/tesseradata/datadr">datadr</a> that is part of the <a href="http://tessera.io">Tessera</a> project. These objects are the basis for creating Trelliscope displays, and while in this particular example we are working with a small in-memory data set, DDOs are designed to be able to be distributed across many disks on a cluster when dealing with large data sets. For more information about this type of data structure, see the <a href="http://tessera.io/docs-datadr">documentation for datadr</a>.</p>
<p>To inspect the output of the result of <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_tr</code></pre>
<pre><code>

<div id="assessing-fits-with-holdouts" class="section level2">
<h2>Assessing fits with holdouts</h2>
<p>One way to assess the fit of different methods is to fit the model with one observation held out for each subject. After fitting we can compute the mean squared difference between the fitted value and the observed value at each holdout point.</p>
<p>A convenience function for adding a holdout variable to a data set is provided, <code><a href='rd.html#add_holdout_ind_alias'>add_holdout_ind</a>()</code>. We can add a holdout indicator to the SMOCC data sample with the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
smc &lt;- add_holdout_ind(smc)
head(smc)</code></pre>
<pre><code>    src subjid rec nrec   agedays    sex etn ga   bw htcm wtkg   haz

6 7.136618 FALSE</code></pre>
<p>By defualt, <code><a href='rd.html#add_holdout_ind_alias'>add_holdout_ind</a>()</code> will hold out a random observation. If we specify <code>random = FALSE</code>, it will hold out the last observation.</p>
<p>To apply a fitting method honoring the new holdout variable, we simply set <code>holdout = TRUE</code> in our call to <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_alias'>get_fit</a>()</code>. Let’s do this for “wand”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wandfit_hold &lt;- get_fit(smc, y_var = &quot;haz&quot;, method = &quot;wand&quot;, holdout = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>We can now apply the fit to each subject.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_tr_wand_hold &lt;- fit_all_trajectories(smc, wandfit_hold)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can compute the MSE values for each fit with a convenience function <code><a href='rd.html#get_fit_holdout_mse_alias'>get_fit_holdout_mse</a>()</code> (this can of course be done manually as well).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_fit_holdout_mse(smc_tr_wand_hold)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.2618989</code></pre>
<p>We can apply the same approach to other fitting methods and compare the MSE. Below, we will show how we can examine Trelliscope displays to visually investigate overfitting, etc.</p>
<p>This method can be used to explore different parameter choices within one fitting method or multiple fitting methods across the same or multiple data sets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="trelliscope" class="section level1">
<h1>Trelliscope</h1>
<p>A useful approach to visualize the outputs of per-subject trajectory fits is to create Trelliscope displays. You can learn more about Trelliscope <a href="http://tessera.io/docs-trelliscope/">here</a>. The <code>trelliscope</code> R package is a dependency of <code>hbgd</code> and creates a <a href="http://polisci.msu.edu/jacoby/uic/manuscripts/95.8.color.pdf">Trellis</a>-style display, where each subset of a data set is plotted in a single panel and the panels are arranged in a grid of rows and columns. What distinguishes Trelliscope from Trellis Display is the ability to create Trellis displays with a potentially extremely large number of subsets. To help the user navigate the space of many panels, the user can specify “cognostics”, or metrics that capture something interesting about each subset.</p>
<p>We won’t go too much more into the details of Trelliscope here, but provide a few examples. First, there are a few built-in methods that easily create Trelliscope displays from the resulting object of <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code>. These methods have default functions for what to plot and what to use as cognostics. Also, we provide an example of how to create your own custom Trelliscope display.</p>
<div id="built-in-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Built-in methods</h2>
<p>Plot data, WHO standard, and fitted line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trscope_trajectories(smc_tr)</code></pre>
<p>Plot data, WHO standard, and fitted line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trscope_trajectories(smc_tr, center = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>When centering height around the WHO median, we are plotting the <a href="(http://www.ifpri.org/blog/once-stunted-always-stunted-whats-catch-growth)">HAD</a>.</p>
<p>Plot data, WHO standard, and fitted line on z-scale:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trscope_trajectories(smc_tr, z = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Plot fit velocities:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trscope_velocities(smc_tr)</code></pre>
<p>Plot z-score fit velocities:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trscope_velocities(smc_tr, z = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="comparing-fitting-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparing fitting methods</h2>
<p>One useful feature of Trelliscope is the ability to compare fits across different methods. For example, suppose we wish to fit the “smooth.spline” method and compare the fitted values visually.</p>
<p>We can get the broken stick fit and make a Trelliscope display of the fit on the z-score scale with a few simple commands:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ssfit &lt;- get_fit(smc, y_var = &quot;haz&quot;, method = &quot;smooth.spline&quot;)
smc_tr_ss &lt;- fit_all_trajectories(smc, ssfit)
trscope_trajectories(smc_tr_ss, z = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This will add a new Trelliscope display to our list of displays. If we now open up the Trelliscope viewer, we can select, for example the display titled “htcm_vs_agedays_wand_ztrajectory” and once it is opened, we can click on “Related Displays” on the left sidebar and then scroll and select “htcm_vs_agedays_smooth.spline_ztrajectory”. Now for each subject we will see the two different fits side-by-side.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-your-own" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating your own</h2>
<p>See the <a href="http://tessera.io/docs-trelliscope">Trelliscope docs</a> for more information. Here is a quick example. Suppose we want to make a Trelliscope display of the residuals. We simply need to grab one subset of the data, create a panel function on that subset that work, and then apply it to the entire <code>smc_tr</code> data using <code>makeDisplay()</code>. More explanation will be added here later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># get a subset
x &lt;- smc_tr[[2]]$value

# create a panel funciton
panel_fn &lt;- function(x) {
  if(is.null(x$resid))
    return(NULL)
  xyplot(x$resid ~ x$xy$x)
}

# test the panel function
panel_fn(x)

# make a cognostics function that gets the residual std dev
cog_fn &lt;- function(x) {
  if(is.null(x$resid)) {
    resid_sd &lt;- NA
  } else {
    resid_sd &lt;- sd(x$resid, na.rm = TRUE)
  }
  list(resid_sd = cog(resid_sd,
    desc = &quot;Standard deviation of residuals&quot;))
}

# test cognostics function on a subset
cog_fn(x)

# make the display
makeDisplay(smc_tr,
  name = &quot;residuals&quot;,
  panelFn = panel_fn,
  cogFn = cog_fn
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="division-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Division Methods</h1>
<p>Many of the methods in this package rely on splitting the data into pieces and applying methods independently to each piece and then recombining the result in some way that is meaningful for our analysis. We call this process Divide and Recombine (D&amp;R). Most often the way we want to divide the data is by <code>subjectid</code>, although there are others.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, we use the <a href="http://github.com/tesseradata/datadr">datadr</a> package to create divisions (this package is a dependency of <code>hbgd</code> and is installed with it so there is no need to install <code>datadr</code> separately). We already implicitly created a division by calling <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code>. However, we may want to explicitly create divisions for specific purposes.</p>
<p>Here we show a few kinds of divisions and how to create them, with some additional helper functions that ship with the package. For more depth on the D&amp;R process and usage of <code>datadr</code>, see <a href="http://tessera.io/docs-datadr">here</a>.</p>
<div id="by-subject" class="section level2">
<h2>By subject</h2>
<p>The way to create a division using the <code>datadr</code> package</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_subj &lt;- divide(smc, by = &quot;subjid&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>There also is a helper function, <code><a href='rd.html#by_subject_alias'>by_subject</a>()</code> that does the same thing and makes sure that additional data attributes are perserved:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_subj &lt;- by_subject(smc)</code></pre>
<p>We can use this as an input to <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code> (if we send in the SMOCC data frame, it will automatically first compute the division for us). Additionally, we can do other D&amp;R operations. For example, if we want to compute the number of rows in the data set for each subject and bind those results into a single data frame, we can do the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(
smc_subj %&gt;%
  addTransform(function(x) nrow(x)) %&gt;%
  recombine(combRbind))</code></pre>
<pre><code>  subjid val
1  10001  10
2  10002   9
3  10003  10
4  10004  10
5  10005  10
6  10006  10</code></pre>
<p>Again, we refer you to the <code>datadr</code> <a href="http://tessera.io/docs-datadr">documentation</a> to better understand these kinds of operations and other operations you can do.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-trajectory-checkpoints" class="section level2">
<h2>By trajectory checkpoints</h2>
<p>Another useful and slightly more complicated division we might want to obtain is a partitioning of each subject’s data according to the location of their trajectory at specified checkpoints. This can be very useful, for example, when trying to make comparisons between children who were stunted or not at, say, ages 1 and 2 years.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a function <code><a href='rd.html#by_trajectory_checkpoints_alias'>by_trajectory_checkpoints</a>()</code> that takes as an input the output of <code><a href='rd.html#fit_all_trajectories_alias'>fit_all_trajectories</a>()</code> and groups the data for each subject according to the specified checkpoint locations and z-score bins. In this example, the checkpoints are at 1 and 2 years and the z-score bins are &lt;-2 (stunted) and &gt;-2 (not stunted). We are using the <code>smc_tr</code> object we computed <a href="#fitting-all-trajectories">previously</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>smc_cp &lt;- by_trajectory_checkpoints(smc_tr)
# look at result
smc_cp</code></pre>
<pre><code>
Distributed data object backed by &#39;kvMemory&#39; connection

 size (object)  | 107.12 KB
 # subsets      | 1

* Other attributes: getKeys()
* Missing attributes: splitSizeDistn</code></pre>
<p>We see this is a “distributed data frame” (DDF) - a special kind of DDO where each subset is a data frame. This only has one subset. We can look at the key for this subset with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>getKeys(smc_cp)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[1]]
[1] &quot;365=&gt;-2|730=&gt;-2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Since by default out only checkpoint cutoff is at <code>z = -2</code> with checkpoints at 1 and 2 years, we are breaking our data into subsets based on which category the subject is in at each checkpoint time. For the SMOCC sample, it turns out that every subject we are looking at is not stunted at years 1 and 2. A more diverse data set would potentially yield a division with up to 4 subsets for stunted / not-stunted at years 1 and 2. In that case, we can use this division to make plots of differences in variables between the different checkpoint categorizations, etc.</p>

<div id="multi-dataset-vis" class="section level1">

<div id="plot-matrix-comparing-variables-present-in-a-list-of-studies" class="section level4">

</div>
<p>Variables on the x-axis are ordered from most prevalent across data sets to least, and within each group are ordered by variable type and then alphabetically.</p>
